## Content

### 1. [Basic LoadBalancer](LAB01/Dockerfile_Build_And_Push_to_ACR.md)

   Build a custom Docker image from a simple Node.js application and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).

### 2. [Standard LoadBalancer](LAB02/Standard_Loadbalancer.md)

   Dive deeper into LoadBalancer concepts, focusing on the standard configuration and its benefits for your AKS deployment.

### 3. [Traffic from Internet](LAB03/Traffic_from_internet.md)

   Learn how to manage and route traffic from the internet to your AKS cluster, ensuring seamless connectivity for your applications.

### 4. [External Nginx Ingress Controller + Cert Manager](LAB04/External_Nginx_Ingress_Controller_Cert_Manager.md)

   Implement an external Nginx Ingress Controller along with Cert Manager to manage SSL/TLS certificates, enhancing the security of your AKS applications.

### 5. [External Application Gateway Ingress Controller](LAB05/External_ApplicationGateway_Ingress_Controller.md)

   Explore the integration of the Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller to efficiently manage ingress traffic in your AKS cluster.

### 6. [Create AKS using CLI](LAB06/Create_AKS_using_CLI.md)

   Master the creation of AKS clusters using the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI), providing a hands-on experience in deploying Kubernetes on Azure.

### 7. [AKS Authorization](LAB07/AKS_Authorization.md)

   Understand and implement role-based access control (RBAC) in AKS, ensuring secure access and permissions for users and applications.

### 8. [AKS + Azure AD](LAB08/AKS_Azure_AD.md)

   Integrate AKS with Azure Active Directory (AD), enabling seamless authentication and authorization for your Kubernetes workloads.

### 9. [Users in AKS](LAB09/Users_in_AKS.md)

   Explore user management within AKS, including creating and managing user accounts, providing a comprehensive understanding of identity and access management.

### 10. [Dynamic Volumes](LAB10/Dynamic_volumes.md)
